# nand2tetris
My implementation of the Assembler and VM in Python for the [nand2tetris](https://www.nand2tetris.org) course.

Note that the code is not very Pythonic because the initial plan was to implement it in C after prototyping it in Python, but eventually I decided to keep it in Python as is...
